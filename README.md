ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NeilScrivens

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Terraform but currently interested in IaC generally. 

I have previous experience with Vagrant, Ansible, Chef and Puppet.

As I work more within hybrid infrastructure environments I would like to expand my knowledge to include AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager and SaltStack

Iâ€™m a big fan of Python, both Monty and Guido Van Rossum's and always willing to collaborate on projects. 

You can reach me ...
